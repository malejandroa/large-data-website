##Visual Style Description1. First Style is a light, minimal, geometric, clean style with earth colors. I wanted to focus on earth and nature. Pictures are bright and ""corporate" style, its a sophisticated website. 2. Second Style, has a black background, still keeps the earth tones but I wanted to focus in two elements, sky and earth. It uses an elegant serif font; This is my first pick as I think the contrasts and text work pretty well. 3.Third Style is more edgy, uses bright colors kind of "new age style" and uses a darker background to contrast the bright colors. I wanted to create a high contrast still using a serif font to keep it elegant.
