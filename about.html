        <h3>Meditation: Etymology</h3>
        <p><em>The Tibetan word for meditation</em> "Gom" means "to become familiar with one's Self" and has the strong implication of training the mind to be familiar with states that are beneficial: concentration, compassion, correct understanding, patience, humility, perseverance, etc.
Apart from its historical usage, the term meditation was introduced as a translation for Eastern spiritual practices, referred to as dhyāna in Buddhism and in Hinduism, which comes from the Sanskrit root dhyai, meaning to contemplate or meditate. The term "meditation" in English may also refer to practices from Islamic Sufism, or other traditions such as Jewish Kabbalah and Christian Hesychasm. An edited book about "meditation" published in 2003, for example, included chapter contributions by authors describing Hindu, Buddhist, Taoist, Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. Scholars have noted that "the term 'meditation' as it has entered contemporary usage" is parallel to the term "contemplation" in Christianity, but in many cases, practices similar to modern forms of meditation were simply called 'prayer'. Christian, Judaic and Islamic forms of meditation are typically devotional, scriptural or thematic, while Asian forms of meditation are often more purely technical.<br /><br/>
According to Ariel, David S. says that meditation was not something practiced without deliberation and prior commitment to the Jewish faith. from the fraternities of Merkava meditation to the whole Hasidic communities engaging in meditative act, Jews were expected to follow Jewish laws and customs at the very least moreover, as seen in cases of the Prophets and later meditation techniques, a certain level of purification was needed.</p>
