There are many schools and styles of meditation within **Hinduism**. Yoga is generally done to prepare one for meditation, and meditation is done to realize union of one's self, one's atman, with the omnipresent and non-dual _Brahman_. This experience is referred to as moksha by Hindus, and is similar to the concept of Nirvana in Buddhism. The earliest clear references to meditation in Hindu literature are in the middle Upanishads and the Mahabharata, which includes the ?**Bhagavad Gita.__**__[97]____[98]__ According to Gavin Flood, the earlier _Brihadaranyaka Upanishad_ refers to meditation when it states that "having becoming calm and concentrated, one perceives the self _(ātman)_ within oneself".__[99]__

**_Within Patañjali's_** ashtanga yoga practice there are eight limbs leading to _kaivalya_ "aloneness." These are ethical discipline _(yamas)_, rules _(niyamas)_, physical postures _(āsanas)_, breath control _(prāṇāyama)_, withdrawal from the senses _(pratyāhāra)_, one-pointedness of mind _(dhāraṇā)_, meditation _(dhyāna)_, and finally _samādhi_, which is often described as the realization of the identity of the Self _(ātman)_ with the omnipresent _(Brahman)_, and is the ultimate aim of all Hindu yogis.
