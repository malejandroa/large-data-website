**Buddhist meditation** refers to the meditative practices associated with the religion and philosophy of Buddhism. Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient Buddhist texts and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. Buddhists pursue meditation as part of the path toward Enlightenment and Nirvana.**[79]** The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are _bh훮van훮_,**[80]** _jh훮na/dhy훮na_,**[81]** and _vipassana_. According to Manmatha Nath Dutt, there is hardly any difference between mainstream Hinduism's Dhyana, Dharana and Samadhi with the Buddhist Dhyana, Bhavana, Samadhi, especially as both require following the precepts (_nayas_ _and niyamas_.)
