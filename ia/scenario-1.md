##Scenario 1##


**I am a…** 22 year old full time student, who has a very stressful schedule, I study Interactive Multimedia and work 10 hours a week. I spend a lot of time in the computer, which keeps me in my head all of the time. recently, I haven't been able to sleep as I have been having problems relaxing  and I want to find a way to give myself time and space for peace and quiet, but due to my work overload and lack of time I can't seem to find a way to give myself this space. I am aware of meditation practices, bugt I know little about it. 

**I want to…** find more information about Meditation. I wish there was a site where its concise enough to be able to address the different kinds of meditation are there to be able to practice. 

**So I can…**teach myself about meditation, without having to leave my house. I want to be able to I can get to pick a method of training myself, but first I need to educate myself as I'm just getting into it.
