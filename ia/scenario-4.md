##Scenario 4##

**Why would I come to your website…**I would come to your website if I find it simple enough to navigate, clear enough to find the information that I need, which it has to be updated, concise and easy to read. I don't want to waste time looking all over for what I want or dealing with complicated information or long articles, unending articles. 

**What do I hope to accomplish by visiting your website…**I hope to every day be able to read a couple of articles about meditation. I want to teach myself about it, little by little. I want to also be able to find practical excersises I can do every day. I want thos website to be my tool to help me find a meditation path it suits me. 

**What characteristics of the site might help or hinder his or her site interaction?…**I dont like complicated sites. Many times, I do read information in my phone, and non-responsive web pages just annoy me. i dont like things popping on my face, interrupting my reading or trying to sell me things. I dont like long articles, i'm not looking for poems, I need concise information. I dont have the time to read how beautiful peiople write. Just get the message across. I also need to trust your information.
